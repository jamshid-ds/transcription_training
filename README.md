Prepared for Intern Data Scientist Vacancy

**Task**
- Collect a 1GB Uzbek audio dataset including both transcriptions and audio recordings.
- Data Preparation:
    - Remove any disallowed characters from the transcriptions.
    - Convert all transcriptions to lowercase.
    - Convert any numbers present in the transcriptions to strings.

**Guideline**

- First, you'll need to collect the audio dataset. Make sure to collect both audio files and their corresponding transcriptions.
- **Data Preparation**: As mentioned earlier, you need to prepare the data by removing disallowed characters, converting transcriptions to lowercase, and converting numbers to strings.
- **Model Training (ASR)**: You can use existing ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) frameworks like Deep learning models.
    - Preprocess the audio data (e.g., convert to appropriate format, resample, etc.).
    - Prepare the transcription data in a format suitable for training.
    - Train the ASR model using the prepared dataset.
    - Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics to assess its performance.
- **Result Sharing (Google Colab)**: Once you have trained your model, you can share your results using Google Colab. Google Colab provides a platform for running Python code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
